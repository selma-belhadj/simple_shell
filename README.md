# Simple Shell
> In this project, we coded from scatch a simple Unix shell. A shell is an interactive
> command-line interpreter. We created a shell that would utilize the command line
> interface (CLI). It allows users to type in a defined set of
> commands (e.g. "rm" to remove files, "cat" to combine word documents, etc) and have the
> operating system run the appropriate function. It is slightly different from a graphical user
> interface (GUI).
> A user can create/write/read/open/remove folders, print things to the terminal, change directories, print where you are
> in the system, etc. 

### Synopsis
> This repository holds all the code necessary for our custom simple shell to run.
> Our shell currently handles the executions of executables found in the
> environmental variable PATH, with or without their full paths. Sample commands
> that our shell supports include ```ls``` (```/bin/ls```), ```pwd```, ```echo```,
> ```which```, ```whereis```, etc. We've also created the following builtins.
